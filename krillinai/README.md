# KlicStudio

KlicStudio is a minimalist AI-powered video translation and dubbing platform developed by Krillin AI. The system transforms video content through automated speech recognition, LLM-based translation, and text-to-speech synthesis to produce localized content with subtitles or complete audio dubbing across multiple languages and output formats.

The platform provides dual deployment modes (desktop application and web server) while maintaining a unified backend processing core. It integrates with multiple AI service providers through configurable abstractions, supporting both cloud-based and local model execution. The system handles end-to-end video processing from URL/file input to final multi-platform output generation.
